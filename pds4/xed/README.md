# xed - xml editor

## About the name

`xed` is like `sed`, but for xml. Specifically, it's for PDS4 labels. It might work for other files, but I haven't tested this and wouldn't recommend it. It aims to perform small edits to xml files from the command line with a great degree of control.

## Modes of operation

`xed` supports two modes of operation: ad-hoc and json mode.

### Ad-hoc mode

Ad-hoc mode runs a single operation on a batch of files. It can be performed entirely from the command line, Unlike sed, only a single command can be run from the command line at a time. This makes the commands easier to read than sed.

Example:
```bash
./xed.py --command <command> --path <path> --name <name> --value <value> <files>
````

* *Command* is the command that you want to run on the file. A list of commands is below.
* *Path* is the XPATH expression that points to the element you want to operate on. If your path points to multiple elements, it will operate on all of them.
* *Name* is usually the name of the element you want to create. It depends on the command
* *Value* is usually the content of the element that you want to add. This also depends on the command.


*command* and *path* are always required. Whether *name* and *value* are required depends on the command. See the command reference below.

### JSON mode

JSON mode runs a list of commands, specified in a json file, on a batch of files. Using compounded edits, it's possible to completely remake a label with this mode. It would be better to use a different tool to build labels from scratch, though.

Example:
`./xed.py --json <json file> <filenames>`

a json file would look like:

```json
[
  {"command":  "(command name)", "path":  "(path}", "name": "(name)", "value": "(value)" },
  {"command":  "(command name)", "path":  "(path}", "name": "(name)", "value": "(value)" }
]
```

This is very similar to the ad-hoc usage.
